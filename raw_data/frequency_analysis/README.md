Included is the 現代日本語文字データベース（CDJ） Ver. 2.0 （研究用）
created by 作成者：松下達彦 ( http://www.wa.commufa.jp/~tatsum/ )
and downloaded from http://www17408ui.sakura.ne.jp/tatsum/database.html

symbols.txt is a file I created based on characters found in source input
that did not exist in the character database but could appear in legitimate
sentences so I did not want to heavily penalize them.
